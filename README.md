# CityBuilder
Description of the Project:

The game allows players (mayor) to build and manage a city, assigning different zones (residential, industrial, service) and constructing service buildings. Citizens automatically build homes and workplaces, influenced by factors like satisfaction, safety, and proximity to services. The player's goal is to satisfy population while maintaining a balanced budget through taxes and controlled expenses. The game features real-time gameplay with adjustable speeds, time indicators, and 2D top-view graphics. Balancing citizen satisfaction, budget, and city development is crucial to prevent game over scenarios. The user interface provides information on budget, satisfaction, and zone dynamics.
